# RAG-Model-Chatbot-with-Azure-OpenAI-and-Local-Documents
This project demonstrates how to build a chatbot using a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) model with Azure OpenAI for language processing and a local document vector database for document retrieval. The chatbot can handle various document types (PDF, PPTX, DOCX, TXT) and supports interactive user sessions with a chat history.
